## Data coverage in D1

| Table | Source | Range | Latest |
|---|---|---|---|
| `balance_sheet`, `income_statement`, `loans`, `deposits`, `financial_ratios`, `other_data` | BDDK monthly bulletin | 2020-01 → present | 2026-04 |
| `weekly_series` | BDDK weekly bulletin | 2019-11 → present | rolling 2-week lag |
| `evds_series` | TCMB EVDS | 2018-01 → present | daily / weekly / monthly per series |
| `tbb_digital_stats` | TBB quarterly digital-banking report | 2019-Q1 → present | quarterly (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec) |
| `kap_ownership` | KAP Genel Bilgi Formu §5 + §7 subsidiaries (kap.org.tr) | current state per bank (`as_of` = filing date) | weekly full replace; 30/31 banks (ATBANK files no form); subsidiaries grid only on the full form (~15 banks) |
| `tefas_manager_daily`, `tefas_category_daily`, `tefas_allocation_daily`, `tefas_top_funds` | TEFAS fund-market JSON API (tefas.gov.tr) | rolling ~5 years (API rejects older start dates) → present | daily T+1, trading days; aggregated at ingest (no per-fund rows) |
| `bank_audit_balance_sheet` (assets / liabilities / off-balance) | BRSA quarterly PDFs | 2022-Q1 → 2026-Q1 | per-bank |
| `bank_audit_profit_loss` | BRSA quarterly PDFs | same | per-bank |
| `bank_audit_credit_quality` | BRSA PDFs, IFRS 9 footnotes | same | per-bank, per-section |
| `bank_audit_profile` | BRSA PDFs, qualitative section | same | branches + personnel where disclosed |
| `bank_audit_capital` | BRSA PDFs, §4.1 capital adequacy | same — **fully backfilled 2026-06-10** (31/31 banks, ~1.7k rows) | CET1/Tier1/Tier2/Total/RWA + CET1/Tier1/CAR ratios, per period_type |
| `bank_audit_liquidity` | BRSA PDFs, §4.6/4.7 | same — **fully backfilled 2026-06-10** (31/31 banks, ~1.8k rows) | LCR (total/FC), NSFR, leverage ratio, per period_type |
| `bank_audit_extractions` | extraction log | one row per PDF | 974 rows (954 ok / 20 partial) |
| `bank_types`, `table_definitions`, `download_log` | metadata | — | — |

**Quarterly audit reports**: 32 banks in URL config, ~974 PDFs extracted into
D1 (~159k balance-sheet rows + ~59k P&L rows + ~7.4k IFRS 9 credit-quality
rows + ~460 bank-profile rows). PDFs themselves live in R2 at
`bddk-audit-reports/<ticker>/<TICKER>_<period>_<kind>.pdf`. Bank profile
(branches + personnel) is extracted where the bank discloses it in a
recognized phrasing — 16 of 31 banks currently parsed; the remaining 15
use phrasings not yet covered by the regex patterns.

**§4 capital/liquidity (2026-06-10)**: full-fleet history backfilled via
`backfill-audit.yml` in 5-bank chunks (`ALL` exceeds the 180-min job timeout).
Per-bank §4 filing quirks and their fixes are catalogued in
[AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md](AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md); the only standing
capital-quality flags are bank-reported BRSA temporary-measure CARs
(ATBANK 2024, TEB consolidated 2022) — false positives, not parse errors.
Dashboard surfacing (e.g. cross-bank CAR/LCR view) is an open follow-up.

## Bank-type taxonomy

Monthly `bank_type_code` (per the `bank_types` table) gives TWO overlapping
partitions of the sector — never add across them:

- **By type** (= Sector 10001): Deposit (10002) + Participation (10003) + Dev&Inv (10004)
- **By ownership, all types** (= Sector 10001): Private/Yerli Özel (10005) + State/Kamu (10006) + Foreign/Yabancı (10007)
- **Deposit-only ownership**: Deposit-Private (10008) / Deposit-State (10009) / Deposit-Foreign (10010)

`10006` "State" therefore spans every type — it includes state-owned
participation (Ziraat/Vakıf/Emlak Katılım) and development banks (Eximbank,
Kalkınma, İller), not just the three state deposit banks (those are `10009`).
The **weekly** bulletin numbers the same groups differently — see METRICS.md §2.

## Active workflows

Two independent ingestion lanes (separate staging DB + R2 snapshot +
concurrency group), so audit failures can't stall the bulletin pipeline:

- `.github/workflows/refresh-evds-daily.yml` — Sun–Fri 05:00 UTC. EVDS scrape → D1. Also carries the non-critical TBB / KAP / TEFAS steps of `refresh.py` (TEFAS re-fetches a trailing 7-day window daily — self-heals T+1 lag, holidays and revisions).
- `.github/workflows/refresh-bddk-bulletins.yml` — Sat 02:00 UTC. Monthly + weekly bulletins (no EVDS, no audit) → D1.
- `.github/workflows/refresh-data.yml` — Sat 03:00 UTC. Monthly + weekly + EVDS + TBB digital-banking (quarterly) + KAP ownership structure + TEFAS fund market → D1. *(Audit removed — now its own workflow.)* TBB, KAP and TEFAS are non-critical steps in `refresh.py` (an outage won't abort the BDDK refresh); they ride the bulletin lane's snapshot, so no new lane. KAP details in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) §KAP ownership; TEFAS in §TEFAS fund market.
- `.github/workflows/backfill-tefas.yml` — manual dispatch only. Resumable ~5-year TEFAS history backfill (the API rejects start dates older than 5 years; 28-day windows, rate-limited ≈2–2.5 h; re-dispatch with the same `from` to resume — completed windows are skipped via `tefas_fetch_log`).
- `.github/workflows/refresh-audit.yml` — Sun 04:00 UTC. Audit-report sync + extract → `bank_audit_*` → D1. Own DB `data/bank_audit.db`, own snapshot `state/bank_audit.db.gz`, own group `bddk-audit`. Manual dispatch takes optional `bank` / `skip_scrape` inputs (the /admin per-bank trigger uses `bank` → `--only-bank … --latest-period`). After extraction it runs `scripts/check_audit_quality.py --alert` (alert-only): flags a quarter whose lines are identical to the prior one (period-shift), a balance sheet that doesn't balance, or missing rows → Telegram/Discord, never blocking the push.
- `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` — on push to `web/**`. Apply D1 migrations + build + deploy dashboard.
- `.github/workflows/healthcheck.yml` — daily 06:00 UTC. D1 freshness check → Telegram/Discord alert if stale. Also runs `scripts/verify_chart_spec.py --alert`: re-resolves every reproduced chart in `web/app/lib/chart-specs.catalog.json` against D1 and alerts if a series goes blank (0 rows) or drifts past its `verify[]` anchor. See [REPRODUCING_CHARTS.md](REPRODUCING_CHARTS.md).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — on PRs. ruff + pytest + eslint + tsc. (Dependency bumps via `dependabot.yml`.)

Schema source of truth: hand-authored migrations in `web/migrations/`, applied
by the deploy workflow (`wrangler d1 migrations apply`); `d1_migrations` tracks
what's applied.

## Dashboard

Next.js 16 (React 19, TypeScript 6) + OpenNext on Cloudflare Workers — live at
<https://turkish-banking-dashboard.incesalim10.workers.dev>. D1 reads are cached
~12h via KV (`cachedAll` → `unstable_cache`), so repeat page views don't re-query
D1. A password-gated `/admin` control center (data health, refresh triggers,
traffic) is unlocked by the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` Worker secret; optional
`GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN` enables the trigger buttons and Web-Analytics creds the
traffic panel. The Pipeline panel's audit card supports a **per-bank,
latest-period** trigger, and **13 banks auto-discover** new quarters from their
IR page (no hand-added URL needed) — see [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md) §Auto-discovery.
Setup in [OPERATIONS.md](OPERATIONS.md) / [ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md).

The **Profitability** tab (`/profitability`) carries a **NIM components**
decomposition replicating the BBVA "NIM components of private banks" chart from
the monthly bulletin: eight interest income/expense buckets
(`income_statement` items 1–14 / 16–22) as % of 13-month-average total assets,
as annual stacked bars (plus a current-year YTD-annualized bar — actuals, not
BBVA's forecast) and a monthly trailing-12-month view, switchable across bank
groups ("Private" = deposit codes 10008+10010, the BBVA definition; verified to
0.1pp). Data layer `web/app/lib/nim-components.ts` + `nimComponentsRaw()` in
`metrics.ts`; guarded by the `profitability.nim_components_private` chart spec.
See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) §16.

A **Liquidity** tab (`/liquidity`) adapts the BBVA "Banking Sector Outlook"
liquidity section: TL & FC loan/deposit ratios and TL deposit growth split
Public (state) vs Private (private + foreign), deposit dollarization, net CBRT
funding, gross reserves, residents' household FC savings, and REER. See
[METRICS.md](METRICS.md) §12.

An **Economy** tab (`/economy`) adapts the Türkiye macro section of the BBVA
"Türkiye Economic Outlook" (1Q26): GDP growth, industrial production, labor
market, CPI vs CBRT funding cost, inflation expectations, ex-ante real rate,
USD/TRY + REER, 12m-rolling current account (total / ex-gold / ex-gold&energy)
and net errors & omissions, fiscal balances as % of GDP, plus BBVA's static
baseline-scenario table. Fed by a `macro` EVDS block (GDP, IP, labor, BoP,
budget — 15 new series incl. CPI 2025=100, which replaces the dead 2003=100
index). See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) §14.

A **Digital** tab (`/digital`) surfaces the TBB quarterly digital/internet/mobile
banking statistics (`tbb_digital_stats`, sector-wide): channel adoption (active
mobile vs internet customers; mobile-only/both/internet-only usage), quarterly
money-transfer volume (₺ trn) & count and bill-payment count split internet vs
mobile, and demographics of active individual digital customers (gender + age).
Data layer `web/app/lib/digital.ts` pins verified full-history series by their
`(channel, segment, section, unit, metric_slug)` key. See [METRICS.md](METRICS.md) §13.

A **Funds** tab (`/funds`) surfaces TEFAS fund-market sector aggregates: AUM by
fund type (mutual / pension / ETF, ₺ trn) with a CPI-deflated index, mutual-fund
AUM by category (the money-market & hedge-fund boom), AUM-weighted portfolio
allocation, investor-account counts, and the latest top-15 funds per type. Time
series sample the month-end trading day; GYF/GSYF (not daily-priced) are
excluded from trends. Data layer `web/app/lib/funds.ts`. See
[METRICS.md](METRICS.md) §15.

A **Compare** tab (`/cross-bank`) is a cross-bank performance heatmap built
entirely off the per-bank `bank_audit_*` tables (the monthly BDDK tables are
group aggregates only). It puts individual banks side by side across the full
performance set — total assets, NPL ratio, Stage-2 share, NPL coverage,
provision intensity, ROE, ROA, NIM, Cost/Income — each cell colored by the
bank's rank vs peers (green better / red worse; a neutral `--info` ramp for
size). Two views: **Snapshot** (banks × metrics at the latest common quarter,
grouped by BDDK type or sortable by any metric column) and **Over time** (banks
× quarters for one selected metric, scored across the whole panel to surface
trends). The data layer (`web/app/lib/heatmap.ts`) builds one cached panel from
four queries: assets = BS roman I.–X. sum; stage ratios from `bank_audit_stages`;
ROE/ROA/NIM/Cost-Income derived from a P&L pivot by BRSA hierarchy (net profit
`XXV.`→`XIX.`, net interest `III.`, opex `XI.`+`XII.`, gross op profit `VIII.`)
over equity (BS liab `XVI.`), with YTD flows annualized × (4/quarter). Rank +
color logic is the pure, client-safe `heatmap-normalize.ts`.

A qualitative-data layer feeds two tabs from the `news_items` table
(`scripts/sync_news.py`, daily cron):

- **/regulation** — primary regulator feeds: TCMB press releases + BDDK board
  decisions, with a weekly AI thematic briefing. Per-bank KAP disclosures
  surface on each bank's page.
- **/news** — banking-sector *journalism* aggregated from TR financial-media
  RSS feeds (Bloomberg HT, Dünya, Ekonomim, AA, NTV) via
  `src/news/sources/press.py`, keyword-filtered to banking-relevant items
  (`source='press'`). Feed list is hand-edited in `data/news/press_feeds.json`.
  Only headline + link + snippet are stored (no full body); cards link out.
  Removing a feed there purges its stored items on the next cron (a one-time
  manual D1 delete clears what was already pushed). Hürriyet was dropped — its
  RSS froze a stale Oct-2024 block.

## Known issues / pending work

- **TEFAS funds lane shipped (2026-06-11)** — `tefas_*` aggregates in D1,
  `/funds` tab live. Caveats by design: investor counts double-count people
  holding several funds; GYF/GSYF excluded from time series (not daily-priced);
  manager names extracted from the fund-title prefix (sector sums are invariant
  to mis-bucketing); changing any normalization rule requires re-running the
  backfill (aggregated at ingest, per-fund rows not persisted). The healthcheck
  `tefas` threshold (120 h on the data date) may fire one benign alert over
  multi-day religious holidays. Follow-ups: a manager/bank-affiliated view off
  the existing `manager` dimension; carry-forward aggregation for GYF/GSYF.
- **KAP ownership lane shipped (2026-06-11)** — `kap_ownership` in D1
  (379 rows, 30/31 banks; weekly via `refresh-data.yml`). Surfaced on
  `/banks/[ticker]` as an Ownership card (≥5% direct + indirect holders with
  share bars, paid-in capital / registered ceiling, per-class actual free
  float; `web/app/components/OwnershipCard.tsx` + `web/app/lib/kap.ts`) and a
  Subsidiaries & financial investments table (§7 grid, item='subsidiary',
  amounts in the filing currency; `SubsidiariesCard.tsx`, migration 0007 —
  only the ~15 full-form banks file it). ATBANK publishes no Genel Bilgi
  Formu (cards hidden); `as_of` filing dates can be years old
  (structure-change driven). Possible follow-up: ownership taxonomy
  cross-check vs `bank_types`.
- **Interactive ownership visualization shipped (2026-06-12)** — two views off
  the same `kap_ownership` data: an interactive radial map on `/banks/[ticker]`
  (shareholders fan the top arc, §7 subsidiaries the bottom; hover tooltip,
  click-to-pin details panel; `OwnershipRadial.tsx`) and a sector-wide
  `/ownership` network tab (banks on a circle grouped by BDDK type; only
  entities shared across ≥2 banks drawn inside — Treasury/TVF/BKM/Takasbank/
  KGF/… — plus bank-to-bank stakes as dashed arrows, e.g. İş → TSKB/Arap Türk,
  Ziraat → Ziraat Katılım; wheel-zoom/drag-pan, click a bank to focus its fan,
  `?focus=TICKER` deep links). Cross-bank identity is exact-match alias
  normalization in `web/app/lib/ownership-graph.ts` (Turkish-aware case fold;
  the İş pension fund name contains "İŞ BANKASI" — never substring-match).
  All custom SVG, no new deps; one new all-banks query `sectorOwnership()` in
  `web/app/lib/kap.ts`.
- **Audit rework Phases 3–4 complete (2026-06-11).** Fleet history repaired in
  7 gated batches (28 banks + ALBRK/BURGAN re-repair in batch 7 after the §4
  CI chunk backfills clobbered Monday's fix via last-writer-wins on the R2
  snapshot — operational rule now in AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md). Verification
  gates caught and we fixed mid-run: a D1 service transient (now auto-retried
  3×), the header filter eating squished OFF-BALANCE data rows (ISCTR — also
  recovered off-balance totals lost since the original extractor), and
  honest-skip classification (EMLAK/ICBCT/PASHA single malformed rows now
  visibly flagged instead of silently garbage). bank_audit_validation is in
  D1 (2,898 rows; push_to_d1 now maps validated_at; scripts/
  revalidate_audit_db.py recomputes after validator changes); /banks period
  columns show ⚠ on identity-failing quarters and /admin has the per-bank
  validation table. 165 partitions still fail identity checks (TSKB damage +
  investigate-bucket quirks) — visible, itemized, iterative fix targets.
- **Audit rework Phases 0–2 complete (2026-06-10, docs/AUDIT_REWORK_PLAN.md).**
  Phase 0: all 975 PDFs profiled (`scripts/profile_audit_corpus.py` →
  `data/audit_profiles.json`; census + format-drift + §5 footnote inventory
  generated into AUDIT_BANK_CATALOG.md). Phase 1: extraction-time internal-sum
  validator (`src/audit_reports/validator.py` → `bank_audit_validation`,
  D1 migration 0005, `structure` quality check). Phase 2: full-fleet dry-run
  re-extraction into a scratch DB with old-vs-new evidence
  (`data/backfill_evidence/report.md`). Dry-run findings already fixed:
  QNBFB phantom page-header rows, SKBNK leading-dipnot corruption. Findings
  excluded from repair: ISCTR 2025Q1 consolidated (PDF has no text layer —
  a backfill would destroy its D1 rows), TSKB 2025 split-digit quarters.
  **NEXT: user reviews report.md buckets → Phase 3 batchwise D1 repair →
  Phase 4 dashboard states → Phase 5 footnote foundation.**
- **Balance-sheet rows dropped / corrupted by spurious number matches (resolved
  2026-06-10).** `extractor.py`'s `_parse_rows` counted three non-values as
  value columns: the row's own hierarchy token (`2.4`, `1.1.4.`), the dash
  inside the label decoration `(-)`, and the parenthesized dipnot ref `(6)`
  (which `parse_num` reads as **-6**). A 6-column row could then "carry 9
  numbers", triggering the EXIM multi-period branch (first-6 → garbage values),
  while the `rfind`-based label boundary landed at position 0 (row silently
  dropped) or inside `(-)` (label truncated at `(`, dipnot stored as the
  value). Surfaced as ALBRK's `/banks` page showing **Expected Credit Losses =
  -6** (true value 6,057,750 at 2025Q4); the new `ecl` quality check found the
  class across **17+ banks / ~435 (bank, quarter, kind) rows** (AKTIF ALNTF
  ATBANK BURGAN EMLAK EXIM FIBA HALKB HSBC ING KLNMA PASHA QNBFB TEB TFKB TSKB
  ZIRAATK; TEB lost its ECL rows every Q4; ALBRK/EMLAK lost them in 2026Q1).
  Fix: scan value tokens with `finditer` positions (label = text before the
  first taken token), skip a leading hierarchy marker, anchor the bare dash to
  whitespace, and drop parenthesized 1–2-digit dipnot refs when the line has
  surplus tokens; `_fitz_merge_rows` accumulation now counts with the same
  rules. Regression-verified on 29 PDFs covering every layout quirk (EXIM
  multi-period, AKBNK fitz path, ZIRAAT/VAKBN wrapped rows, TSKB squished
  text): zero count decreases, zero total changes; every bank *gains* rows
  (e.g. GARAN 32→46 asset rows — the bug also dropped non-ECL rows
  fleet-wide), and ALBRK 2025Q4 recovers its `TOTAL ASSETS` row. A new
  `check_audit_quality.py` **ecl** check alerts on truncated labels, tiny
  |ECL| on large banks, and ECL rows vanishing vs the prior quarter. Notes:
  ING/KLNMA/PASHA/TFKB print the ECL *value* in parens → stored negative is
  the faithful reading (display-normalization is a follow-up); TSKB has
  separate pre-existing split-digit damage (`…(-) 1.849.927 5.` label) still
  open. Full-fleet re-extraction backfilled to D1 + the R2 snapshot via
  `scripts/backfill_extraction.py --banks ALL`.
- **Stage-3 NPL understated by FC-only sub-table (resolved 2026-06-07).** The
  per-bank NPL ratio / coverage on `/cross-bank` (and per-bank pages) was
  understated for ~11 templated banks because the IFRS-9 Stage-3 extractor's
  **template path** latched onto the *foreign-currency-only* NPL sub-table
  ("Yabancı para olarak kullandırılan…" / "in foreign currencies") instead of
  the total III/IV/V classification — so e.g. DENIZ read 0.00% (real ~5.4%),
  AKBNK 0.73% (real ~3.8%), ZIRAAT/ISCTR/YKBNK/TEB/KUVEYT/AKTIF/FIBA/ICBCT/ODEA
  all similarly low. Root cause: those banks' main provision/gross rows use
  labels that differ from their `audit_templates.json` entry ("Karşılık (-)" vs
  template "Karşılık Tutarı"), so the template could only pair gross+provision
  *inside* the FC-only block. Fix: the template path now skips FC-only blocks
  (shared `_is_fc_only_block` helper, already used by the regex path); when that
  leaves no template gross row, extraction falls back to the language-agnostic
  regex path, which scopes the total table correctly. Verified on all 11 changed
  banks (each old value = that bank's FC-only subset; each new value = the total
  NPL movement row); 18 banks unchanged, **zero regressions**. 2026Q1 backfilled
  to D1 + the R2 snapshot via `scripts/backfill_extraction.py --banks ALL
  --latest-period`; the 11 affected banks' **history** backfilled separately so
  the `/cross-bank` Over-time view has no fake cliff. A new
  `check_audit_quality.py` **npl_drop** check now alerts if any quarter's Stage-3
  ratio crashes from ≥1% to <0.1% (the fingerprint of this bug) on a future
  report-format change. Minor residual: ODEA's regex pick takes the prior-period
  end-balance when current < prior (~2% high) — immaterial to ranking.
- **EXIM multi-column report (resolved 2026-06-06).** Eximbank's recent reports
  (2025Q3+) print 3 balance-sheet period columns (TL/FC/Total × current / prior /
  restated) and a 4-column interim income statement (cumulative + 3-month ×
  current / prior). The extractor assumed 2 periods and took the wrong columns —
  storing the prior period as current, so EXIM's figures showed under the wrong
  dates. Both are now handled in `extractor.py` (BS: take the first triplet pair
  on >6-column rows; P&L: `_detect_pl_ncols` → cumulative current = col 0, prior
  = col n//2), validated to be a no-op for the 2-column banks, and EXIM was
  re-extracted + backfilled to D1 + the R2 snapshot via
  `scripts/backfill_extraction.py`. EXIM is the **only** bank with the 3-period
  balance sheet (verified by `scripts/audit_extraction.py` + a D1 duplicate-quarter
  scan). Credit-quality / stages / loans / NPL tables were unaffected.
- **Grand-total rows now captured (2026-06-06).** `TOTAL_PAT` only matched
  English `TOTAL`, so Turkish reports' `VARLIKLAR TOPLAMI` / `PASİF TOPLAMI`
  grand-total rows were dropped (they carry no hierarchy prefix). Now also
  matches `TOPLAM`. Dashboard total-assets was **never** affected (it sums the
  roman subtotals I.–X., not the total row — `web/app/lib/audit.ts`); this is
  completeness + it lets the data-quality balance check cover all banks.
  Verified across all banks: **26/27 now capture both totals and balance**;
  only **AKBNK** still misses total *liabilities* (its label is detached from
  the numbers row in the PDF — a narrow per-bank layout quirk; the balance check
  skips it rather than false-alarm). 2026Q1 was backfilled to D1 + the R2
  snapshot via `scripts/backfill_extraction.py --banks ALL --latest-period`,
  which now **clears each re-extracted (bank, period) partition in D1 before the
  upsert-only push** — otherwise an older, larger extraction leaves orphan rows
  at item_orders the fresh extract no longer produces.
- **TSKB 2026Q1** — bank rotated their IR URL; current entry in
  `audit_report_urls.json` 404s. Skip for now; refresh the URL when TSKB
  publishes the next quarter.
- **A handful of pre-existing partial extractions** (~2% of PDFs flagged
  `success=0` in `bank_audit_extractions`, 20 of 974) — mostly VAKBN
  consolidated historical quarters with layout edge cases. Triable
  bank-by-bank if needed.
- **Bank-profile coverage gap** — 15 of 31 banks (AKTIF, ALBRK, ATBANK,
  BURGAN, EMLAK, EXIM, FIBA, ING, ISCTR, KLNMA, KUVEYT, ODEA, TFKB, TSKB,
  VAKIFK) disclose branches/personnel in phrasings not yet covered by the
  regex patterns in `src/audit_reports/bank_profile.py`. Add patterns as
  needed; the qualitative section is always in the first 25 pages.
- **Rates dashboard** — some panels from the old Dash app aren't ported yet
  (gold tons, expectations). CBRT reserves, net funding and residents' FC are
  now live on the new **Liquidity** tab.
- **Monthly EVDS series were silently empty** until the 2026-06-05 date-parse
  fix in `evds_client._parse_evds_dates` (EVDS returns monthly dates as
  `YYYY-M`, previously dropped). CPI, inflation expectations, REER and
  residents' FC repopulate on the next refresh. New series added: REER
  `TP.RK.T1.Y`.
